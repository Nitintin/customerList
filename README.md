# TRAVCLAN INTERVIEW TASK

This project was build using ReactJS. All the latest technologies like ContextAPI, Hooks, ES6 have been used in this project.


# ASSUMPTIONS
The only assumption that i made was to about the number of customers thats needs to be visible per page. As of now, only 3 customers are visible per page.

# MUST - HAVE Tasks
There were four primary must have tasks that need to be completed in this assignment. Task one was to display a list of customers along with pagination. This has been completed succesfully and can be seen right from the index page. Task to was to display maximum bits by default and to have an option to toggle it to minimum bids. This has also been acieved succesfully. Button at the top write of the application can be used to toggle. Task three was to enable sorting. Sorting has been achieved based on Ascending order and descending order of the bid selected. Task four was to use ES6 and react hooks. the entire website has been built using these technologies only!

# GOOD TO HAVE TASK
First good to have task was to use context API. The same has been used effeciently to manage flow of data. The second good to have task allowed the user to click on any route in order to check list of entire bids placed by that particular customer. This has been achieved by using Routers.
The only task which was not fulfilled was material-ui styling. Time constraint played a major role in this. If given more time, this can also be achieved!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
